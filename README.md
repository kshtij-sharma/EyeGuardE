This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for detecting Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal images. Using Python, it employs deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify retinal fundus images for the presence and severity of DR.

The process starts with data preprocessing, including image normalization, resizing, and augmentation to enhance the model's performance. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. A CNN architecture is trained to identify features associated with different stages of DR (e.g., no DR, mild, moderate, severe, and proliferative).

The trained model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Once deployed, it can assist in early detection, reducing the risk of vision loss by prompting timely medical intervention.

The project integrates libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy, offering an accessible approach to automating DR detection in the healthcare field.
